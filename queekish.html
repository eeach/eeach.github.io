<h1>Queekish</h1>

<p>While Skaven have a native language called Queekish, they
fluently speak the Manthing tongue so as to better strike fear
into the hearts of their enemies. The Skaven have made a few
improvements to the Manthing language showing their superiority
over their weak and stupid enemies. These changes are as follows.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Skaven chatter a lot. In the Manthing tongue they will,
        in their excitement, repeat words for emphasis. Ex. <strong>Die-Die
        Manthing!! Run-Run!! Greetings-Greetings! Skuttle
        Quick-Quick!!!</strong></li>
    <li>Skaven view themselves as superior to all other races.
        They refer to civilized races as <strong>Manthing,
        Dwarfthing, Elfthing,</strong> etc.</li>
    <li>Skaven in their political cesspool have mastered
        flattery. When asking a favor, in fear of being punished,
        or other dealings where they may need your cooperation
        they will shower you with compliments such as "<strong>Most
        prestigious of prestigious Lords</strong>" or "<strong>Greatest
        of vile vermin</strong>."</li>
    <li>Skaven have mastered mud-slinging. When enticing someone
        to work against another Skaven or another Clan they will
        detract from their intended target with phrases like
        "<b>That backstabbing coward of Clan Skryre, the Horned One chew-chew 
    his intestines!!</b>"</li>
    <li>Few female Skaven escape the breeding warrens of
        Skavenblight. Skaven refer to all females as <strong>breeders</strong>.
        They have no other word for the female gender.</li>
    <li>When Skaven are excited they tend to chatter uncontrollably: <strong>Neek-Neek</strong>.</li>
    <li>When Skaven are afraid they make high pitched whining
        sounds: <strong>Eeek-Eeek!!!</strong></li>
    <li>Although not a part of the spoken language, Skaven tend
        to touch what ever they are talking to.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Skaven Runes</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p class="runes">Few humans have ever ventured into Skavenblight,
and fewer still have ventured out. For many decades, despite the
appearance of skaven runic symbols on battlefields across the old
world, it was believed that the Skaven lacked a written language
of their own. In support of this theory, it was pointed out that
Skaven battle standards are often written in the common tongue,
bearing such epitaphs as "we shall inherit" and
"wither and decay." However, we now know that the
Skaven use the common tongue solely for their opponent's benefit
- in an attempt to break enemy morale. Onlly recently, through the
interrogation of human cultists of the Horned Rat, and careful
study of a few captured tattered pages of the "Liber
Boubonicus" have the mysteries of the Skaven written
language begun to unravel.</p>

<p>The Skaven alphabet contains 19 letters. There is no
hard and fast rule concerning whether material is written from
left to right, right to left or up and down.</p>

<p>Each of the 19 letters takes the form of a runic symbol. These
symbols, when appearing alone, have a distinct meaning within
Skaven society. In addition, however, the word or phrase
associated with each symbol also represents a certain sound in
the Skaven alphabet. For example, the skaven symbol for the word
"warpstone" may appear alone, and often does. However
when it appears with a group of other symbols it may also
represent the "Wa" sound, or the letter "W".</p>

<p>In addition to their 19 letters, the Skaven alphabet contains
7 vowels. The vowels are often omitted in informal writing, as
the Skaven vocabulary appears to be so limited as to have little
need of them. Thus, a word like "water" will usually
appear using the runic symbols for "W", "T"
and "R" only.</p>

<p>Finally, the Skaven use a single punctuation symbol in their
writings: the double scratch mark, or "//" symbol. When
this symbol appears after a word, the word is always pronounced
in a stuttering fashion, such as "Die-die" or
"Hate-hate". No other punctuation is known to exist in
the Skaven written language. It is believed that the question
mark is not used because written requests are of no importance in
Skaven society. No Skaven would ever respond to a request
such as "where is the warpstone kept." Such
information would only be given in person, either to a more
powerful Skaven, or extracted by his assassins.</p>
