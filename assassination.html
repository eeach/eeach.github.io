<p class="botr">The nature of Skaven society means that
everything goes. Conspiracy, plotting, back-stabbing,
assassinations, intrigue, spying, scheming, violence, and
treachery are all acceptable as long as one is cunning and strong
enough to pull it off. This behavior in this rat-eat-rat world of
dark ambition is central to Skaven society, and highly respected
and valued. In this environment, the strong will reign over the
weak, strengthening Skaven society. Skaven society is one vicious
circle of violence, influence, and treachery, which none are able
to escape. To let one's guard down for even a moment will result
in a well placed dagger in the back.</p>

<p>Skaven are in constant conflict with each other. The motives
could be as simple as killing another clanrat to keep attention
on yourself, or as complex as trying to eliminate a political
opponent for your Clan Warlord. What ever the reason,
assassination is <em>very</em> common in Skaven society.</p>

<p>At Belegarth, there is <strong>always</strong> an
&quot;Assassins Tournament&quot; in progress among the Skaven.
The rules for this tournament are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Assassination may occur anywhere except the following: <strong>a)</strong>
        public areas not related to Belegarth (parking lots, away
        from the event site, etc.), <strong>b)</strong> troll or
        other &quot;official&quot; areas at events, <strong>c)</strong>
        showers and bathrooms at events, <strong>d)</strong> the
        sidelines at battle practice. This list may not be
        exclusive.</li>
    <li>An assassination may occur on the battlefield. However,
        it is not possible to assassinate an opponent (someone
        not on your team that you would kill anyway).</li>
    <li>Assassination to increase your position in Skaven society
        is only possible at an event (ex. you may only kill your
        hostleader to take his place at an event).</li>
    <li>Every Skaven will be given a Life Token at every battle
        practice and each day of an event. This token should be
        placed on a thong on the Skaven's belt. This token counts
        as a Minor Token.</li>
    <li>When you are killed in an assassination attempt (if you
        are assassinated or if you botch an assassination), give
        your Life Token to the Skaven (or team of Skaven) that
        killed you. You are now &quot;dead&quot; and can no
        longer gain or loose Life Tokens for the remainder of the
        day.</li>
    <li>Assassins may work as a team. Any Life Tokens gained by
        the team are divided anyway that the participants in that
        team choose (ex. they may all go to the leader, are
        divided equally, or you get the Token if you strike the
        killing blow). If you are dead, you cannot aid in an
        assassination (attacking or defending).</li>
    <li>When you have 30 Life Tokens, you may trade them in for
        an Assassin's Token. An Assassin's Token is simply a
        display of your ability to use guile to destroy an
        opponent or to resist attempts on your life. This token
        counts as a Major Token.</li>
    <li>Non-Skaven cannot assassinate Skaven.</li>
