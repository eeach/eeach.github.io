<h2>Clan Eshin</h2>

<p class="botr">After the disaster at Skavenblight, and
the appearance of the Grey Lords, Clan Eshin set off to the East
under the leadership of a Grey Lord known as Lord Visktrin. While
crossing the Mountains of Mourn in the far east, Lord Visktrin
was mortally wounded in a battle with a dragon. Before Lord
Visktrin died, he appointed a successor and commanded the Clan to
continue east. The Clan, following its bidding, disappeared into
the East and was not heard from for hundreds of years.</p>

<p class="botr">When they arrived in Imperial Cathay
they quickly learned of the intrigues of the Far East. By
observing the Warrior Monks of Cathay and the cold efficiency of
the Ninja of Nippon, they honed their skills in such deadly arts.
Clan Eshin would later reappear to assist the Council of Thirteen
in stalemating Clan Pestilens and bringing order to the Skaven
Under-Empire.</p>

<p class="botr">Clan Eshin is one of the most powerful
Clans in the Skaven Under Empire. Their Clan is synonymous with
murder, poison, and assassinations, and even their reputation is
a weapon in itself. They hire their services out to the other
Clans, and despite their feigned political neutrality, are deeply
immersed in plotting and scheming. While neither the most
influential nor the largest of Clans, they are one of the most
feared, and they have an incredible degree of knowledge about the
other Clans from spies and agents.</p>

<p class="botr">The Leader of Clan Eshin is the
Nightlord. From there, the Clan follows a convoluted Hierarchy
appointed by the Nightlord. All appointments must be approved by
him, giving him powerful control. The leadership of the Clan
exists based on proximity to the Nightlord. He does rely on a
series of recommendations, allowing for a lot of political
rivalry and plotting. Inter-Clan assassinations, done well, are
secretly approved of, while botched assassinations against Clan
Eshin members are punishable by death.</p>

<h3>Eshin Clan Structure</h3>

<ul class="center" id="clans">
    <li>Clan Rat - Strangler</li>
    <li>Host Leader - Gutter Runner</li>
    <li>Clan Chieftan - Death Master</li>
    <li>Clan Warlord - Nightlord</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clan Eshin Champion Tokens</h3>

<p>Rats of Clan Eshin are more adept at killing than there
non-ninja brethren. This is represented by special rules for Clan
Eshin in the <a href="assassination.html" target="_blank">assassination
tournament</a>. These special rules are as follows:</p>

<ol class="center" id="eshin">
    <li>When Skaven of Clan Eshin assassinate on behalf of
        another (one of their Clan superiors, a member of another
        Clan, etc.) the Eshin Assassin and his patron divide the
        Life Token between them. This is done by giving the Life
        Token gained in the assassination to the patron and the
        Eshin Assassin will get a duplicate Life Token from his
        direct clan superior. Both Life Tokens are functionally
        the same, they are not &quot;half tokens&quot; or the
        like.</li>
    <li>When Skaven of Clan Eshin work as a team, all of the
        Eshin in the team gain a Life Token for each victim that
        the team kills. This is only possible if <strong>every</strong> Skaven
        in the team is from Clan Eshin and only if the team
        initiates combat.</li>
    <li>When Skaven of Clan Eshin botch an assassination, they
        loose two Life Tokens. If a team of Eshin botch an
        assassination, every Skaven in the team looses three Life
        Tokens.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Weeping Blades</h3>

<p>At each national event the rats of Clan
Eshin will display the number of Assassin Tokens that they
possess. The Assassin with the most Tokens will be awarded the
Weeping Blades.</p>
