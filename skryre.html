<h2>Clan Skryre</h2>

<p class="botr">After the disaster at Skavenblight, the
Greylords led the Skaven to all corners of the world. The Grey
Lord who commanded Clan Skryre decided to keep his Clan behind at
Skavenblight. It was here in Skavenblight that Clan Skryre turned
their energies on the study of their foul arts, and picked apart
the machinery that had created the disaster, tearing apart its
secrets. When the local Clans sought to conquer Clan Skryre's
holdings, they turned their knowledge to war, and quickly
enslaved a number of Clans. Clan Skryre quickly rose to great
power in the Council, and the Warlocks of Clan Skryre played an
important role in battling the Undead at Cripple Peak.</p>

<p class="botr">When the Council, and their dominion
over Skavendom was challenged by Clan Pestilens, they turned to
an alliance with Clan Eshin. With the introduction of all these
new and powerful major Clans, Clan Skryre's supremacy was
gradually eroding. When the Second Civil War broke out, as the
result of Council actions at the behest of Clan Skryre, Clan
Skryre unleashed used its mighty arsenal and seized and held the
Shattered Tower for the remainder of the war. Eventually when the
war ended with the Incarnation of the Horned Rat, and Clan Skryre
resumed its role in the Council.</p>

<p class="botr">Clan Skryre is a Clan that bases its
power on knowledge and a bizarre blending of magic and
technology. The power in the Clan is based not on Chieftains and
Warlords, but rather ability in the magical arts and
technological knowledge. The Warplock Engineers of Clan Skryre
form the leadership, with those who are the most powerful
assuming dominance over the less powerful. The head of the Clan
is the most powerful Warplock Engineer, Lord-Warlock Morskittar,
also one of the most powerful Councilmembers.</p>

<p class="botr">The troops that Clan Skryre uses are
armed with an arsenal of weaponry. Not only are their opponents
hammered by the magical knowledge of Clan Skryre, but also they
find themselves attacked by Doomwheels, Warpfire Throwers,
Warplock Jezzails, and Poison Wind Globes. Although their numbers
may be small, their weapons are capable wreaking mass
destruction, and many of the Skaven's greatest victories have
been due to the ability and weaponry of Clan Skryre.</p>

<h3>Skryre Clan Structure</h3>
<ul class="center" id="clans">
    <li>Clan Rat - Warpseer</li>
    <li>Host Leader - Warpweaver</li>
    <li>Clan Chieftan - Warpsquealer</li>
    <li>Clan Warlord - Lord Warlock</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clan Skryre Champion Tokens</h3>

<p>Clan Skryre collects two types of Champion Tokens, Strength
Tokens and Engineer Tokens.</p>

<p>Everytime a rat of Clan Skryre breaks a well constructed
weapon (the core must snap), they get one Strength Token. This
token counts as a minor token. The rat must be wielding the
weapon when it breaks, if someone's weapon breaks when they block
your strike, that does not count. A well constructed weapon is
one made of a quality core (sch. 40 or 80 pvc, fiberglass, etc.
<strong>no ultra-lights, kitespar, golf clubs</strong>) that has not been weakened in any substantial way
(drilled, grooved, etc.). When you collect 5 Strength Tokens, you
may trade them in for one Might Token. A Might Token counts as a
Major Token.</p>

<p>Rats of Clan Skryre gain Engineer Tokens (Minor Tokens) when
they create innovative devices for use on the Dagorhir
battlefield. The device need not pass a weapon inspection
(although an unreasonably persistent attempt must be made), just
the presentation of the device and review by a Herald. When 15
Engineer Tokens have been collected, you may trade them in for
one Warplock Token (Major Token).</p>

<h3>The Fellblade</h3>

<p>At each national event the rats of Clan
Skryre will display the total number of Might and Warplock
Tokens that they possess. The Warplock Engineer with the most
Tokens will be awarded the Fellblade.</p>
