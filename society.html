<h1>Skaven Society</h1>

<p class="botr">Skaven adhere to a consistent social
hierarchy exhibited in nearly all the clans. The social
relationships within the Clan are the basis upon which individual
Skaven relate to each other. The rules maintained and promoted by
the hierarchy are followed by nearly all Skaven, and frames the
everyday interactions, roles, and tasks expected by the Skaven.
These roles for all Skaven are fixed, and upward mobility is only
possibly through guile, treachery, and exploiting the rules of
the existing hierarchy.</p>

<h2>Clan Structure</h2>

<p>Although each Clan has different titles associated with each
step in its social hierarchy, the requirements to achieve each
step are the same. Presented below are the social ranks of the
Skaven with &quot;generic&quot; terms related to them. For titles
related to a specific Clan, read <a href="clans.htm">Skaven
Clans.</a></p>

<h3>Clan Rats</h3>

<p>When you are born, if you survive the miserable conditions of
the warrens (and your mother is to weak to kill you) you become a
clan rat. Used as slaves in the mines or fodder on the
battlefield clan rats usually have a very short and miserable
life. If you survive your first few encounters on the
battlefield, you my gain privileges to the warrens or maybe small
gifts from your hostleader that wants to keep you working for his
prestige.</p>

<p>To become a clan rat at Belegarth, you must:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Be a member of Belegarth and show a basic understanding of
        Belegarth Rules</li>
    <li>Have the minimum garb required by Belegarth Rules
        (preferably dark colors and tattered/rat-like)</li>
    <li>Express a will to become a Skaven</li>
    <li>Choose one of the four clans to represent</li>
</ol>

<h3>Hostleader</h3>

<p>If you survive long enough as a clan rat, you may be noticed
by a rat of some importance (maybe a Clan Chieftain or the Clan
Warlord) or maybe your Hostleader will meet an untimely end
putting you in his place. Hostleaders are the lowest commanders
of a Skaven Clan's guard, ruling over 3 or more clan rats.</p>

<p>To become a Hostleader, you must:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Have been a clan rat</li>
    <li>Demonstrate basic knowledge of your clan's history and
        hierarchy</li>
    <li>Use Queekish regularly on the battlefield</li>
    <li>Recruited 3 or more people to the Skaven cause</li>
    <li>Possess 2 Major Tokens</li>
    <li>Complete a trial of your Clan Chieftain's choosing or <a
        href="assassination.htm" target="_blank">Assassinate</a>
        one Hostleader</li>
</ol>

<br />

<h3>Clan Chieftain</h3>

<p>Fairing well in the political maneuverings of the various
Hostleaders, you may find yourself in the position to increase
your influence over the clan. Positioning yourself as a true
leader (far removed from the frontline of battle), you may notice
that one of the current Clan Chieftains is not paying much
attention to his rear. Although not the highest in
authority, Clan Chieftains deal with most day-to-day issues that
effect their clan. Because the Clan Chieftains are so close to
everything that happens to the clan, they wield quite a lot of
power but are also blamed for most anything that goes wrong.</p>

<p>To become a Clan Chieftain, you must:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Have been a Hostleader</li>
    <li>Demonstrate ability with three different weapon styles</li>
    <li>Recruited 6 or more people to the Skaven cause</li>
    <li>Possess 5 Major Tokens</li>
    <li>Complete a trial of your Clan Warlord's choosing or <a
        href="assassination.htm" target="_blank">Assassinate</a>
        a Clan Chieftain</li>
</ol>

<br />

<h3>Clan Warlord</h3>

<p>If your spreading influence is not noticed, or the current
Clan Warlord is to stupid to see you as a threat (or maybe you
sabotage a critical item causing an unfortunate end to the
carrier of your current Clan Warlord), you may successfully
supplant the current leader of your clan. The Clan Warlord is the
leader of the entire clan (in your Realm), there may be only one
Clan Warlord per Skaven Clan per Realm. This would seem to put
the Clan Warlord at the top of the hierarchy, but there are
several factors outside of Clan structure that strike fear and
awe into even the most powerful members of any clan.</p>

<p>To become a Clan Warlord, you must:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Have been a Clan Chieftain</li>
    <li>Strike fear and awe into the minds of anyone who looks
        upon you</li>
    <li>Recruited 9 or more people to the Skaven cause</li>
    <li>Possess 9 Major Tokens</li>
    <li><a href="assassination.htm" target="_blank">Assassinate</a>
        the current Clan Warlord</li>
</ol>

<br />

<h2>Non-Clan Titles</h2>

<p>The following are positions in the social hierarchy that are
outside of the clan structure. Grey-Seers and Lords of Decay
actually have no clan affiliation and act on their own whims or
the whims of the Cult of the Horned Rat. The Council of Thirteen,
while they have Clan ties, are above Clan law and answer only to
themselves or to the Horned One.</p>

<h3>Grey-Seer</h3>

<p class="botr">The Grey Seers are the Horned Rat's
representatives and servants among Skaven society. They are free
of all Clan loyalties, and answer only to their superiors in the
Cult of the Horned Rat, the Council of Thirteen, and the Horned
Rat itself. Grey Seers are highly respected and feared in Skaven
society. Few would think to interfere in Grey Seer activities,
and even fewer would think to attack the Grey Seer. Any
intervention in Grey Seer affairs is immediately punishable by
death, by the Grey Seer or minions, immediately there and on the
spot.</p>

<p>To become a Grey Seer, you must:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Have recruited 6 or more people to the Skaven cause</li>
    <li>Demonstrate the ability to read and write Skaven Runes</li>
    <li>Have appropriate Grey Seer garb (long robes, gray or
        black, tattered and torn)</li>
    <li>Have a unique Skaven themed healing poem</li>
</ol>

<p>Grey Seers drop all Clan titles from their name, and are no
longer considered part of a mere Clan but beings directly
influenced by the Horned One. Only Grey Seers and members of Clan
Moulder may be healers (The Beastmasters of Clan Moulder being
adept at repairing the results of their work).</p>

<br />

<h3>The Thirteen Lords of Decay</h3>

<p>The Thirteen Lords of Decay are the most powerful members of
the Cult of the Horned Rat. Viewed by most to be as powerful as
the Council of Thirteen (who are appointed by the Horned Rat
himself) the Lords of Decay wield fear as most wield a sword. As
the name suggests, there are only thirteen Lords of Decay. Unlike
Council Members, there is no limit to the number of Lords of
Decay that may reside in a particular realm (other than the
notational limit of thirteen).</p>

<p>To become one of the Thirteen Lords of Decay, you must:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Have been a Grey Seer</li>
    <li>Have recruited 9 or more people to the Skaven cause</li>
    <li>Run 3 or more events with a Skaven theme</li>
    <li>Possess 9 Major Tokens</li>
    <li><a href="assassination.htm" target="_blank">Assassinate</a>
        one of the current Thirteen Lords of Decay</li>
</ol>

<br />

<h3>The Council of Thirteen</h3>

<p class="botr">The Council of Thirteen is undoubtedly
the most powerful and feared authority in all of Skavendom, and
with such esteemed membership as the Horned Rat himself at its
head, the scope and breadth of its power is unsurprising. Few
directly challenge the authority of the Council of Thirteen,
although the more crafty may attempt to circumvent or manipulate
Council decrees.</p>

<p class="botr">The greatest problem involving the
Council is the Council itself. The Council has twelve members,
with the thirteenth position being filled symbolically by the
Horned Rat himself. The Council was set up by the Horned Rat two
centuries ago, according to the dictates engraved on the Pillar
of Commandments. The Council is organized in a circle of power,
with the Horned Rat at the thirteenth and highest position. The
position of the seats is numbered in a circle from the seat to
the left of the Horned Rat, known as the first seat, around the
circle until it ends at the seat on the Horned Rat's right, the
seat number twelve. The occupants of the seats closest to the
Horned Rat at the head of the circle are the more powerful in the
Council of Thirteen. The most prized seats are those directly
adjacent to the Horned Rat's chair, these seats are the first and
twelfth seats.</p>

<p class="botr">When the Council needs to decide on a
motion, action, decree, or referendum, the Council will vote.
Each Council Member may vote in favor or the motion or abstain.
When a Council Member abstains from a vote, it vetoes the vote of
its &quot;opposite number&quot; in the Council. The opposite
numbers are Seats 1 and 12, 2 and 11, 3 and 10, 4 and 9, 5 and 8,
and 6 and 7. This system of opposing votes with vetoes by equally
powerful members of the Council can be paralyzing. Long before a
motion comes to a vote, the political battle begins. Bargaining
of all sorts, threats, blackmail, application of political and
military pressure, bribery, slander, begging, plotting,
conspiring and any other means to pass a vote, or to block an
enemies vote. The alliances are always changing, and the Lords of
Decay see no problem in exercising outside pressure to influence
the Council.</p>

<p class="botr">All too often the political maneuvering
and plotting began before the motion was even placed before the
Council. Lords of Decay will manipulate and interfere with Clan
matters to influence or alter conditions that the Council will
meet upon; rivals will seek to counter these moves by using other
Clans to prevent further plotting or progress. By plotting and
scheming beyond the Council chambers they hope to further their
own ends. The subterfuge played within and without the Council
Chambers is unsurpassed anywhere else in the Old World.</p>

<p>The Council of Thirteen decides everything that will effect
Skaven on a national level. As stated above, there are only
twelve members of the Council of Thirteen. There may only be one
Council Member that resides in a particular realm per Clan
represented in that realm. (ex. If a realm has Skaven of Clan
Eshin and Clan Pestilens but no other Clans, that realm can have
up to two Council Members. These Council Members may both be from
Clan Eshin, both from Clan Pestilens or one from each, but there
may be only two Council Members in that realm.)</p>

<p>To become one of the Council of Thirteen, you must:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Be a Clan Chieftain or Clan Warlord for one of the four
        clans</li>
    <li>Have recruited 9 or more people to the Skaven cause</li>
    <li>Strike fear and awe into the minds of any Skaven or
        manling who looks upon you</li>
    <li>Run 6 or more events with a Skaven theme</li>
    <li>Possess 14 Major Tokens</li>
    <li><a href="assassination.htm" target="_blank">Assassinate</a>
        one of the current Council of Thirteen</li>
    <li>Demonstrate the ability to read and write Skaven Runes</li>
</ol>

<p>The Council of Thirteen is always at war with the Thirteen Lords of Decay.</p>
