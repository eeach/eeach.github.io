  <h1>B is for Bell</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/b_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="73"
      height="63"
    />&quot;Bell&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the symbol for the &quot;b&quot; sound. Bells have great
    significance in Skaven religion and magic. They are often fashioned to
    resonate at a precise pitch capable of focusing warp energy. See Skaven army
    book, page 41 (heavy Metal) on Screaming Bell Miniature.
  </p>

  <h1>C is for Council</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/c_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="60"
      height="111"
    />&quot;Council of Thirteen&quot; &nbsp;
    <img
      src="./rune/misc1.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="75"
      height="121"
    />&quot;The Gathering of Clans&quot;, or &quot;Clanrats&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    This elaborate design on the left is the symbol for the Council of Thirteen.
    It is also used to represent the capital letter &quot;C&quot;. See Skaven
    army book, page 49 ('Eavy Metal pages), on Screaming Bell miniature.
  </p>
  <p>
    The symbol on the right, three over-lapping lines forming an inverted
    triangle followed by a series of overlapping lines below it of descending
    size represents the joining together of two or more skaven clans for a
    common cause. It is often found adorning the standards of mobs of Skaven of
    more than one clan, collectively known as Clanrats. See Clanrat banners,
    Skaven army book page 49, ('Eavy Metal).
  </p>

  <h1>D is for Dwarf</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/d_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="34"
      height="69"
    />&quot;Dwarf&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A double triangle facing left. This is the symbol for &quot;Dwarf&quot; and
    was adopted from the Dwarven rune for the letter &quot;D&quot;, following
    the fall of Karak Eight Peaks in -c513 (Now known as the Skaven &quot;City
    of Pillars&quot;). It is used as the Skaven letter &quot;D&quot;.
  </p>

  <h1>F is for Fellblade</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/f_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="56"
      height="63"
    />&quot;Fellblade&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the symbol for the dreaded Fellblade. It is also used generically to
    commemorate the defeat of Nagash in -c1200. Although Skaven do not formally
    bury their dead, they have been known to place this symbol over the bones of
    fallen comrades to ward off Necromancers. The symbol is seldom used
    otherwise, unless in its letter-form, where it is given the sound of
    &quot;F&quot;.
  </p>

  <h1>G is for Grey Seer</h1>
  <p>
    <img src="./rune/g1_rune.gif" alt="[IMAGE]" width="63" height="69" />
    <img src="./rune/g2_rune.gif" alt="[IMAGE]" width="57" height="99" />
    <img src="./rune/g3_rune.gif" alt="[IMAGE]" width="63" height="105" />
    <img src="./rune/g4_rune.gif" alt="[IMAGE]" width="65" height="105" />
  </p>
  <p>
    These symbols are used to represent Warlocks and Seers. A single diamond
    with no adornment represents a Warlock Engineer. A stem is added for a
    Warlock Champion. A stem and a single scratch mark signify a Warlock Master,
    while a stem with two scratch marks is the basis for a Grey Seer's blazon.
    Individual Warlocks and Seers generally add additional adornments to these
    basis shapes. Note, however, that Warlocks and Seers never use a
    &quot;horn&quot; on their runes, as would be the case with a Vermin Lord's
    runic symbol, or &quot;<a href="v.html" target="_blank">V</a>&quot;. The
    Grey Seer's symbol represents the sound of the letter &quot;G&quot;. The
    other symbols do not appear to have sounds associated with them. See Skaven
    army book, page 69 far right, page 70 far left, Grey Seer's cloak on book
    cover.
  </p>

  <h1>H is for Horned Rat</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/h_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="67"
      height="73"
    />&quot;Horned Rat&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A diamond with a horn-like extensions forms the symbol for the Horned Rat as
    well as the &quot;H&quot; sound. See Skaven army book, page 60, center rune
    (with vowels).
  </p>

  <h1>J is for Jezzail</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/j_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="70"
      height="77"
    />&quot;Warp energy&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    This symbol represents the machinations of Clan Skryre and all warpstone
    devices, particularly the Jezzail. It therefore has the sound of the letter
    &quot;J&quot;. See Skaven army book, page 60, second rune from the left.
  </p>

  <h1>K is for Skryre??</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/k_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="71"
      height="75"
    />&quot;Skryre&quot; (&quot;wheel&quot;)
  </p>
  <p>
    The three spoked pin-wheel has been adopted as the symbol for Clan Skryre.
    When used as a letter it has the sound of &quot;K&quot;. See Skaven army
    book, page 70, center rune, Doomwheel banner.
  </p>

  <h1>L is for Warlord</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/l_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="49"
      height="53"
    />&quot;Warlord&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A Scratch mark leading into a solid line with a second gouge below it. This
    is the symbol of a Skaven Lord, and is given the same sound as the letter
    &quot;L&quot;.
  </p>

  <h1>M is for Moulder</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/m1_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="69"
      height="61"
    />&quot;Moulder&quot;
    <img
      src="./rune/m2_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="91"
      height="79"
    />&quot;Moulder&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A fist holding a whip. This symbol is often drawn runically as a simple
    series of lines forming a spiral. It is the symbol of Clan Moulder, and is
    used to represent the letter &quot;M&quot;. The more elaborate symbol to the
    right usually adorns shields and banners of the clan, as well as the gates
    to the Hell Pit. See Skaven army book, pages 11 and 72.
  </p>

  <h1>N is for Ninja</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/n_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="57"
      height="86"
    />&quot;Eshin&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A small darkened pyramid over a pair of elongated darkened and inverted
    triangles forms the runic symbol of Clan Eshin. Is it the stylistic
    equivalent of the clan's &quot;dagger in hand&quot; glyph, which is painted
    in a glowing mixture of blood and warpstone on the clan's stronghold in
    Cathay. The Symbol has the sound of the letter &quot;N&quot;. See Skaven
    army book, pages 16 and 60, rune on far right, Skaven army book cover.
  </p>

  <h1>P is for Pestilens</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/p_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="65"
      height="101"
    />&quot;Pestilens&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A vertical line with a triangle on the top half, facing right. Similar to
    the letter &quot;P&quot; in appearance, this simple symbol is used by Clan
    Pestilens and has the same sound as the letter &quot;P&quot;.
  </p>

  <h1>Q is for Mine!!</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/q_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="71"
      height="71"
    />&quot;Queek&quot;(&quot;Mine!&quot;)
  </p>
  <p>
    This symbol is usually drawn on objects to denote their ownership. It is
    believed that the particular scent given off by each Skaven's fingernails in
    scratching this symbol on their possessions places other Skaven on notice of
    the owner's claim. The symbol has the sound of the letter &quot;Q&quot;, for
    the skaven word &quot;queek&quot;, which loosely translates into the word
    &quot;mine.&quot; See Skaven army book, page 69, third from left, page 70
    (and the heads and hind quarters of numerous rat ogres and slaves).
  </p>

  <h1>R is for Plague</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/r_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="71"
      height="83"
    />&quot;Red Pox&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    This symbol is used to evoke the inevitable victory of the Children of the
    Horned Rat. It is thus no coincidence that it was first used by Clan
    Pestilens to mark cities infected with the &quot;red pox.&quot; It has the
    sound of the letter &quot;R&quot;.
  </p>

  <h1>Where in the world is Clan Rictus</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/sv_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="71"
      height="71"
    />&quot;Clan Rictus&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the symbol of Clan Rictus of Crookback Mountain, the principle
    Skaven Clan in the Dark Lands. It is unknown what sound, if any, can be
    attributed to this Rune. Clan Rictus breeds a remarkably large number of
    black-furred warriors who in turn make up the bulk of the Skaven military
    elite known as Stormvermin. Their runic symbol is rarely seen on
    battlefields outside of the Dark Lands, as Stormvermin seldom carry shields,
    opting instead to use halberds to maximize their already enhanced strength.
    See Skaven army book pages 6, 7 and 63.
  </p>

  <h1>S is for Skaven</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/s_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="65"
      height="73"
    />&quot;Skaven&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    By far the most common of all Skaven runes, three over-lapping lines forming
    an inverted triangle, simply means &quot;Skaven&quot;, and is also used to
    signify the &quot;S&quot; sound. Its shape embodies the outline of both the
    Horned Rat and the Skaven face, and as such it represents the (so called)
    divine nature of all Skaven. See Skaven army book, page 5 (upper right).
  </p>

  <h1>T is for Home</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/t_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="71"
      height="57"
    />&quot;Skavenblight&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A solid line with two curved lines sloping down vertically from its lower
    half. This symbol resembling a roof and two walls or tower, and is used to
    represent &quot;Skavenblight&quot;. It is also used generically for the
    concept of &quot;tower&quot; and so is assigned the same sound as the letter
    &quot;T&quot;. See Skaven army book, page 69, second rune from the right.
  </p>

  <h1>V is for Vermin</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/v_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="63"
      height="97"
    />&quot;Vermin Lord&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A diamond with a single horn and stem. This is the symbol for the Vermin
    Lord, greater deamon of the Horned Rat. It bears strong resemblance to the
    Horned Rat's symbol, however is given a single horn to indicate its
    subservience to the Horn Rat himself. The Stem represents the connection to
    the material plane on which all Skaven exist. This symbol may also appear
    with scratch marks to separate one individual Vermin Lord from another. When
    appearing in words, this symbol makes the sound of the letter &quot;V&quot;.
  </p>

  <h1>Skaven vowels are as follows:</h1>
  <p align="center">
    <img src="./rune/vowels.gif" alt="[IMAGE]" width="263" height="55" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Skaven vowels are as follows: A single pyramid = a; double pyramid = e;
    triple pyramid = I; single inverted pyramid =o; double inverted pyramid = u;
    triple inverted pyramid = y. As mentioned above, these vowels are seldom
    used, and there appears to be no uniform agreement on their placement. They
    often appear below or above the letters they are intended to modify. This
    may be a matter of Clan dialect.
  </p>

  <h1>W is for Warpstone</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/w_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="67"
      height="75"
    />&quot;Warpstone&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A series of two over-lapping lines crossing at 45 degree angles and forming
    a &quot;tic-tac-toe&quot; board on its side. This symbol represents a series
    of inter-locking tunnels surrounding the world in the never ending search
    for warpstone. The symbol was originally adopted at Cripple Peak by Clan
    Rikek to mark shipments of Warpstone to Skavenblight, and is now generally
    used to represent the letter &quot;W&quot;. See Skaven army book, pages 15
    and 69, second rune from left. (It can also be found on the reverse side of
    the warpstone counters in the Battle Magic supplement).
  </p>

  <h1>X is for Mors</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/misc2.gif"
      width="85"
      height="91"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
    />&quot;Clan Mors&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A crossed series of arrows pointing in all directions incorporating a skaven
    <a href="x.htm#S">&quot;S&quot;</a> runic symbol. This is the mark of Clan
    Moors (pronounced &quot;xmors&quot;). This symbol was first found in the
    vicinity of the City of Pillars, and has come into wide usage to represent
    the letter &quot;x&quot;. The symbol suggests an alliance between the Skaven
    and the minions of Chaos, and ill tidings for all others. See Skaven army
    book, page 9.
  </p>

  <h1>Z is for Magic</h1>
  <p>
    <img
      src="./rune/z_rune.gif"
      alt="[IMAGE]"
      width="77"
      height="73"
    />&quot;ZZZZZZZot&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
    A single horizontal line with a series of zig-zagging lines descending from
    its lower half. This is the symbol for Skaven battle magic, particularly
    Warplightning. Its appearance resembles that of warplightning striking, and
    is given roughly the same sound, corresponding to the letter &quot;Z&quot;.
    See Skaven army book, page 70, second rune from the right.
