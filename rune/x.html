<p>A crossed series of arrows pointing in all directions
incorporating a skaven <a href="x.htm#S">&quot;S&quot;</a> runic
symbol. This is the mark of Clan Moors (pronounced
&quot;xmors&quot;). This symbol was first found in the vicinity
of the City of Pillars, and has come into wide usage to represent
the letter &quot;x&quot;. The symbol suggests an alliance
between the Skaven and the minions of Chaos, and ill tidings for
all others. See Skaven army book, page 9.</p>
