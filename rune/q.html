<p>This symbol is usually drawn on objects to denote their
ownership. It is believed that the particular scent given off by
each Skaven's fingernails in scratching this symbol on their
possessions places other Skaven on notice of the owner's claim.
The symbol has the sound of the letter &quot;Q&quot;, for the
skaven word &quot;queek&quot;, which loosely translates into the
word &quot;mine.&quot; See Skaven army book, page 69,
third from left, page 70 (and the heads and hind quarters of
numerous rat ogres and slaves).</p>
