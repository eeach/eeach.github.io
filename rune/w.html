<p><img src="w_rune.gif" alt="[IMAGE]" width="67" height="75" />&quot;Warpstone&quot;</p>

<p>A series of two over-lapping lines crossing at 45 degree
angles and forming a &quot;tic-tac-toe&quot; board on its side.
This symbol represents a series of inter-locking tunnels
surrounding the world in the never ending search for warpstone.
The symbol was originally adopted at Cripple Peak by Clan Rikek
to mark shipments of Warpstone to Skavenblight, and is now
generally used to represent the letter &quot;W&quot;. See
Skaven army book, pages 15 and 69, second rune from left. (It can
also be found on the reverse side of the warpstone counters in
the Battle Magic supplement).</p>
