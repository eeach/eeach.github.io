<p>These symbols are used to represent Warlocks and Seers. A
single diamond with no adornment represents a Warlock Engineer. A
stem is added for a Warlock Champion. A stem and a single scratch
mark signify a Warlock Master, while a stem with two scratch
marks is the basis for a Grey Seer's blazon. Individual
Warlocks and Seers generally add additional adornments to these
basis shapes. Note, however, that Warlocks and Seers never
use a &quot;horn&quot; on their runes, as would be the case with
a Vermin Lord's runic symbol, or &quot;<a href="v.html"
target="_blank">V</a>&quot;. The Grey Seer's symbol
represents the sound of the letter &quot;G&quot;. The
other symbols do not appear to have sounds associated with them.
