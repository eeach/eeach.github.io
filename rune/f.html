<p>This is the symbol for the dreaded Fellblade. It is also used
generically to commemorate the defeat of Nagash in -c1200.
Although Skaven do not formally bury their dead, they have been
known to place this symbol over the bones of fallen comrades to
ward off Necromancers. The symbol is seldom used otherwise,
unless in its letter-form, where it is given the sound of
&quot;F&quot;.</p>
