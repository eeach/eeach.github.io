<p>A fist holding a whip. This symbol is often drawn runically as
a simple series of lines forming a spiral. It is the symbol of
Clan Moulder, and is used to represent the letter &quot;M&quot;. 
The more elaborate symbol to the right usually adorns
shields and banners of the clan, as well as the gates to the Hell
Pit. See Skaven army book, pages 11 and 72.</p>
