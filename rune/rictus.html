<p>This is the symbol of Clan Rictus of Crookback
Mountain, the principle Skaven Clan in the Dark Lands.
It is unknown what sound, if any, can be attributed
to this Rune. Clan Rictus breeds a remarkably large
number of black-furred warriors who in turn make up the bulk of
the Skaven military elite known as Stormvermin.
 Their runic symbol is rarely seen on battlefields outside
of the Dark Lands, as Stormvermin seldom carry shields, opting
instead to use halberds to maximize their already enhanced
strength. See Skaven army book pages 6, 7 and 63.</p>
