<p>Skaven vowels are as follows: A single pyramid = a; double
pyramid = e; triple pyramid = I; single inverted pyramid =o;
double inverted pyramid = u; triple inverted pyramid = y. 
As mentioned above, these vowels are seldom used, and there
appears to be no uniform agreement on their placement. They
often appear below or above the letters they are intended to
modify. This may be a matter of Clan dialect.</p>
