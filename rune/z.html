<p>A single horizontal line with a series of zig-zagging lines
descending from its lower half. This is the symbol for Skaven
battle magic, particularly Warplightning. Its appearance
resembles that of warplightning striking, and is given roughly
the same sound, corresponding to the letter &quot;Z&quot;. See
Skaven army book, page 70, second rune from the right.</p>
