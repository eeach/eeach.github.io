	<img src="misc1.gif" alt="[IMAGE]" width="75" height="121" />&quot;The Gathering of Clans&quot;, or &quot;Clanrats&quot;</p>

<p>This elaborate design on the left is the symbol for the
Council of Thirteen. It is also used to represent the capital
letter &quot;C&quot;. See Skaven army book, page 49 ('Eavy
Metal pages), on Screaming Bell miniature.</p>

<p>The symbol on the right, three over-lapping lines forming an
inverted triangle followed by a series of overlapping lines below
it of descending size represents the joining together of two or
more skaven clans for a common cause. It is often found
adorning the standards of mobs of Skaven of more than one clan,
collectively known as Clanrats. See Clanrat banners,
Skaven army book page 49, ('Eavy Metal).</p>
