<p>A small darkened pyramid over a pair of elongated darkened and
inverted triangles forms the runic symbol of Clan Eshin. Is it
the stylistic equivalent of the clan's &quot;dagger in hand&quot;
glyph, which is painted in a glowing mixture of blood and
warpstone on the clan's stronghold in Cathay. The Symbol has the
sound of the letter &quot;N&quot;. See Skaven army book,
pages 16 and 60, rune on far right, Skaven army book cover.</p>
