<p>A solid line with two curved lines sloping down vertically
from its lower half. This symbol resembling a roof and two walls
or tower, and is used to represent &quot;Skavenblight&quot;. It is also used generically for the concept of
&quot;tower&quot; and so is assigned the same sound as the letter
&quot;T&quot;. See Skaven army book, page 69, second rune
from the right.</p>
