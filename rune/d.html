<p>A double triangle facing left. This is the symbol for
&quot;Dwarf&quot; and was adopted from the Dwarven rune for the
letter &quot;D&quot;, following the fall of Karak Eight Peaks in
-c513 (Now known as the Skaven &quot;City of Pillars&quot;). 
It is used as the Skaven letter &quot;D&quot;.</p>
