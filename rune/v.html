<p>A diamond with a single horn and stem. This is the symbol for
the Vermin Lord, greater deamon of the Horned Rat. It bears
strong resemblance to the Horned Rat's symbol, however is given a
single horn to indicate its subservience to the Horn Rat himself.
The Stem represents the connection to the material plane on which
all Skaven exist. This symbol may also appear with scratch marks
to separate one individual Vermin Lord from another. When
appearing in words, this symbol makes the sound of the letter
&quot;V&quot;.</p>
