<h1>The Game</h1>
<h4>&quot;Blood Bowl&quot;</h4>

<div id="bloodbowl">

<p>Field: 120yds x 80yds</p>

<p>Equipment: Two ash poles per player approximately 3ft in 
length <br />(Optional) Leather helmet</p>

<p>The Start: A leather ball is placed in the center of the 
field. A signal is given for both teams to advance from their goal lines and 
take control of the ball.</p>

<p>Game Play: Once the ball is in play, it is advanced toward 
the opposing team's goal line. When the ball crosses a goal line the opposing 
team scores (if you carry the ball across your own goal, your opponent scores). 
If the ball is carried out of bounds or makes contact with the ground it becomes 
a &quot;dead&quot; ball. You may never pass toward your opponent's goal, all passes must 
be lateral or backward.</p>

<p>Dead Ball: A dead ball must be started at the point that it 
touched the ground or where it was pushed out of bounds (plays that go out of 
bounds are brought to the lateral center of the field). The ball is started 
from the ground and a lateral or backward pass is made. Players cannot cross 
the lateral position of the ball until the ball is put in to play.</p>

<p>After three successive dead balls, the opposing team takes 
control of the ball and advances it from the point that it last left play.</p>

<p>Scoring: When a ball crosses a goal line, the the goal's 
opposing team gains one point. The ball is then started again (as in the start 
of the first play) one quarter the length of the field from the goal that was 
crossed.</p>

<p>Penalty: Players committing a foul (what few there are) are 
warned the first time, then must sit out until the next complete turnover the 
second (the remainder of their down and all of their opponent's or vice versa), 
and are removed from the game permanently on the third penalty.</p>

<h3>Notes For Belegarth Medieval Combat Society</h3>
<p>This game is actually based on several different sources from fantasy 
literature, movies, table-top games, etc. This game also intentionally 
lacks any &quot;mechanics of play&quot; because it is designed to merge seamlessly with <strong>
any</strong> roleplaying game, using that RPG's rules for movement, conflict 
resolution, etc. Some special notes are needed for use at Belegarth Medieval Combat Society:</p>
<ol>
  <li>No Armor! This game inherently causes its participants to grapple.
  Belegarth Medieval Combat Society rules specifically prohibit initiating a grapple if you are wearing 
  armor. To prevent this from happening no one may <strong>wear</strong> armor while 
  playing this game.</li>
  <li>No missile weapons. This is a game of brute force. It would be 
  cheesy if you could kill the ball carrier from 20 feet away. Also, in my 
  opinion, grappling games and arrows don't mix.</li>
  <li>Follow all Belegarth Medieval Combat Society rules!</li>
</ol>
<p>The spirit of this game is not intended to be fair. While on the whole 
the game is (I think) balanced, I realize that there may be several loopholes 
and or inconstancies in the rules. These should be exploited to the 
fullest. Have fun!!!</p>
