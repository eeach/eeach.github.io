<h1>Skaven History</h1>

<p class="botr">How the Skaven came to plague the world,
none can tell for certain. Stories such as the Curse of Thirteen
claim that Skaven were brought into being by the misdeeds of man.
Some scholars take a less fantastic approach, claiming that the
Skaven are simply mutated rats that have been shaped and formed
by the power of Chaos, and a few scholars claim that Skaven were
once men. The more poetic claim that the Skaven were nurtured by
the darkness of the human soul, whatever that may mean.</p>

<p class="botr">Regardless of their origins, the Skaven
emerged more than fifteen hundred years before Sigmar united the
Empire, in the area of the Blighted Marshes in Tilea. They first
claimed the city of Skavenblight, which many legends and wives'
tales claim was once a human city that is responsible for the
birth of the Skaven race. Whether this is true or not, the city
now known as Skavenblight is the center of the Skaven
Under-Empire.</p>

<p class="botr">The Skaven thrived for years, and as
their power grew, so did their ambition. At this time a number of
Skaven sorcerers developed a cunning plan to tear the very earth
open, sending the cities of man and dwarf tumbling into rifts and
turning the whole of Old World into their domain. The surface
would be scarred by deep fissures in which the Skaven would build
their cities. This ambitious plan however failed, with
catastrophic results. The sorcerous device that was created
malfunctioned, and although Skavenblight was spared, the device
was destroyed as it set off a number of seismic waves through the
ground. Dwarven cities and goblin strongholds crumbled as the
peaks above them came crashing down, sealing millions in their
homes than now became their tombs. Human cities were leveled,
tidal waves swept along the coastline, and many ancient and great
monuments collapsed. However the device did not wreak the
destruction that was anticipated despite the wide spread misery
it caused to everyone.</p>

<p class="botr">Yet despite this calamity, Skavenblight
still stood, and the Temple of the Horned Rat continued to tower
above the ruined landscape. From this temple strode twelve
cloaked and hooded figures speaking with the authority of the
Horned Rat. These messengers were known as the Grey Lords, and
they began the exodus that would send the Skaven to nearly all
the corners of the earth. These Grey Lords were the chosen
disciples of the Horned Rat, and they sought out a plan that
would spread the Skaven across the face of the world, so that no
one disaster could wipe out the Skaven or ruin the Horned Rats
machinations. The Skaven surviving the disaster were divided into
twelve groups, each led by a Grey Lord. One group and their
Greylord remained behind, while the other eleven set off leading
their bands, finding dark homes and spreading the Skaven about so
that no single disaster would ever put an end to the Horned Rat's
plans for dominance.</p>

<p class="botr">The Skaven spread out, and many of the
destroyed or partly demolished Dwarven cities fell to the Skaven,
and many others besieged or harried for centuries. Thousands of
slaves were acquired from the dazed and feuding Dwarves and
goblinoids. Groups of Skaven spread out in other directions, not
to be heard from again for centuries. At this time, the Grey
Lords and the newly established Council of Thirteen forbade
nearly all sorcery to be practiced by the Skaven. Only the Grey
Seers, the priests serving the Horned Rat, and Clan Skryre who
remained behind at Skavenblight researching what had gone wrong
with the device, would be permitted to use magic.</p>

<p class="botr">The Skaven's need for Warpstone brought
them into direct competition with an ancient necromancer of
untold power, a creature known as Nagash. Nagash, undoubtedly the
mightiest of Necromancers had incredible power at his hands and a
massive undead army at his command. To continue his eldritch
rituals, Nagash needed massive quantities of Warpstone to
continue his research, and his fortress at Cripple Peak lay atop
a massive Warpstone meteor, and the Skaven and Undead quickly
went to war over it. The battle would rage for years until the
Skaven successfully assassinated Nagash and claimed Cripple Peak
for their own. Nagash's power over death was however so great
that he would return to Cripple Peak at a later date, and getting
revenge upon Skavendom, crushing Clan Rikek that had settled
there and were mining the warpstone below Cripple Peak. Nagash's
revenge was bitter, however, for by this time the Skaven had
mined most of the Warpstone, and Nagash's power was greatly
diminished.</p>

<p class="botr">A mere century after the Empire was
united under Sigmar Heldenhammer, Skavendom was rent asunder by
the return of one of the departed Clans. Clan Pestilens led by
their Grey Lord, had traveled deserts and seas to find a home in
the continent of Lustria to the far south. Beneath the thick
jungles there the Skaven had discovered abandoned cities of a
once great and advanced culture, and became masters of disease.
The Skaven battled for hundreds of years with the reptilian and
amphibious races of nearby cities, before beginning their exodus
back towards Skavenblight.</p>

<p class="botr">It would be this Clan, Clan Pestilens,
that would bring internecine warfare to Skavendom. Led by a
priesthood known as the Priesthood of Pestilence, Clan Pestilens
swarmed into the Southlands, battling Clans controlled by one of
the few remaining Grey Lords, Grey Lord Azarskittar. Clan
Pestilens mighty and fanatic armies were preceded by horrifying
diseases and their march seemed unstoppable. Clan Pestilens would
eventually meet bitter resistance by the Grey Lord Azarskittar
clinging to his last few strongholds, compelling Clan Pestilens
to shift their momentum of their assault towards Skavenblight.</p>

<p class="botr">The Council was startled by the attacks,
and fought for years to force back Clan Pestilens. Despite their
efforts, nearly all of the Southlands fell under the sway of Clan
Pestilens. Many other Clans, impressed by the onslaught of Clan
Pestilens, switched sides and joined in against the Council. This
state of affairs would continue intermittently for nearly five
hundred years. The balance of power would change with the return
of another distant Clan, Clan Eshin.</p>

<p class="botr">Clan Eshin had been led far to the East,
beyond the Dwarven cities broken asunder, beyond the Dark Lands,
to the area known in the Old World as Cathay by their Grey Seer,
who died upon the journey. There they hid under the mountains,
unbeknownst to the humans living around them. They carefully
watched the humans there, and learned the silent and deadly arts
that the humans there practiced. When Clan Eshin again made
contact with the Council, through pacts that remain a secret even
today, Clan Eshin pledged to serve the Council of Thirteen and
the Cult of the Horned Rat. For the next century, those clans
allied with Clan Pestilens were subjected to an unrelenting
assault of assassinations, sabotage, and kidnappings by the
black-garbed agents of Clan Eshin. Clan Pestilens' position of
power was rapidly eroding under the combined assault of Clan
Eshin, the Council, Clan Skryre, and the wounded and bitter Grey
Lord Azarskittar.</p>

<p class="botr">Clan Pestilens, realizing the danger of
their position, made secret overtures to the Council of Thirteen.
The Council, after centuries of fighting and flushed by their
renewed success, were reluctant to deal with Clan Pestilens, but
the Grey Seers demanded that the Council meet with Clan Pestilens
envoys. The leader of Clan Pestilens, Arch Plaguelord Nurglitch
himself took the harrowing and dangerous mission to Skavenblight,
surviving a number of assassination attempts. Arriving at the
temple, Nurglitch informed the Council that Clan Pestilens would
now be happy to comply and serve the Council, and also informed
the Council that if they rejected Nurglitch's generosity and
turned down the offer, that the Pestilens envoys were carrying on
them the most deadly and virulent of diseases upon them, and
would release them if any ill fortune were to befall them or
their offer. The Council accepted the Clan back into the
Skavendom, and Nurglitch, after defeating another Council Member
in a duel, ascended to the Council of Thirteen.</p>

<p class="botr">With the rift in Skaven society now
closed, the Skaven turned their attention to their opponents
above ground. In 1111, Imperial Calendar, Clan Pestilens released
the Black Plague upon the unsuspecting human cities. The effects
of the disease were horrible, and entire cities were wiped out.
While the disease ran its course, the Skaven boiled out from
their hidden warrens and set waste to the settlements. The next
few years were grim for the Empire and nearby states. As the
disease ravaged the land, Skaven would capture survivors and
enslave them, and the humans could offer little resistance. And
as the Skaven attained greater success on the battlefield, Clan
Pestilens gained incredible power on the Council, earning the
enmity of their rivals. This success of the Skaven would soon
come to an end however.</p>

<p class="botr">The Skaven assault on the city of
Middenheim in 1118 was thrown back, and the disease seemed to be
diminishing in power. Another problem was the very success of the
plague. Bodies were strewn about, and the practitioners of dark
arts had little to fear from the authorities. In the eastern
parts of the Empires, the Skaven would arrive at a plague town to
discover that the dead there had been animated and under the
control of a Necromancer. The Skaven fighting in the East were
soon falling victims to those they had already killed, as the
untiring and fearless Undead and their masters fought over the
collapsing Empire. By 1124 the Empire had made an astounding
comeback and the Skaven were driven under ground and their
enemies, the Necromancers and the Vampires of Sylvania were being
pursued by Witch Hunters and Priests of Morr.</p>

<p class="botr">The Skaven suffered a number of
resounding defeats in the next two decades, and within the
Council of Thirteen Clan Pestilens suffered a loss of prestige. A
century later Clan Pestilens sought to regain its prestige by
releasing the Red Pox upon Bretonnia. The Red Pox failed to
produce the effects that the Black Plague had, and seeing an
opportunity to end Pestilens hegemony over the Council, rivals
demanded their removal from the Council. Upon the day of the vote
to determine the fate of Clan Pestilens in the Council, Clan
Pestilens attempted a coup against the Council, and the Grey
Seers and the albino Council Guards at the Temple of the Horned
battled bitterly to force back the Plague Monks of Clan
Pestilens. War broke out throughout all Skavendom as Skaven
society fractured and old resentments flared anew in the civil
war. Skavenblight and the temple were seized by Clan Skryre, but
their claims of legitimacy were ignored by both Clan Moulder and
Clan Pestilens, while Clan Eshin hired itself out to the highest
bidder. The Grey Seers spent considerable time and effort to end
the civil war, but the treachery and the fighting was so fierce
that few paid them any heed.</p>

<p class="botr">The civil war within Skavendom required
an event of incredible import to occur before it would end. That
even happened during the grisly annual feast to the Horned Rat on
Vermintide in IC 2302. The Grey Seers, after a tremendous effort,
placed an ultimatum on the warring factions, demanding that they
gather together in Skavenblight for this holy day, since this was
the will of the Horned Rat. On this day, for the first time in
history, every clan was represented here in the temple, and as
they waited the Grey Seers began a ritual, asking the Horned Rat
to begin judgement. Their ritual had undreamed of consequences,
the Seerlord presiding over the ritual was torn asunder as the
Horned Rat appeared himself before the assembled cowering
leaders.</p>

<p class="botr">The Horned Rat placed a giant monolithic
obelisk of warpstone in the chamber, a pillar of commandments,
and their bickering must cease since they must turn their
energies upon fulfilling the Horned Rat's plans. Only those
blessed by him could touch the pillar and live, thus joining the
Council of Thirteen. The Horned Rat then returned from whence he
had come. Some Skaven renounced their claims to the Council,
others died touching the pillar, but twelve survived to join the
Council and once more serve the Horned Rat's foul and bloody
plans. With their numbers finally replenished by the draining
centuries long civil war, and a new and united leadership chosen
by the Council of Thirteen, the Skaven are once again ready to
war on the races above ground, ready to inherit a world that the
Horned Rat has promised to them.</p>
