<h2>Clan Pestilens</h2>

<p class="botr">The history of Clan Pestilens begins
with the Disaster at Skavenblight, and their consequent
pilgrimage to Lustria, where they developed their own
&quot;cult&quot; within the Cult of the Horned Rat. They had been
forgotten, and returned to the Old World, battling Skaven Clans
in the Southlands, and went to war with the Council . This war
finally ended in the reintegration of Clan Pestilens into
Skavendom. They were then responsible for the release of a number
of diseases into the Old World, and played a role in the Second
Skaven Civil War.</p>

<p class="botr">Clan Pestilens are foul and verminous,
spreading plague and pestilence through their foul rites and
experiments. Responsible for many of the plagues that swept the
Old World, they are responsible for more deaths than any other
Clan. Filled with ritual, the members of this Clan adopt a
bizarre cult version of the Cult of the Horned Rat, organizing
themselves along religious lines.</p>

<p class="botr">The leader of this Cult is the
Plaguelord, who is, according to the Priesthood of Pestilence,
the favored of the Horned Rat. The Plaguelord is the head of Clan
Pestilens and of the Priesthood of Pestilence. He wields
phenomenal power over the fanatic followers. His servants are the
Plague Priests, who make up the ruling hierarchy of the
Priesthood. Below them are the Plague Monks, the fervent soldier
followers of the Priesthood, who are half-mad with religious
fervor. A small faction, the Plaguelords, are kept separate from
the Clan, and it is these Plaguelords who create and concoct the
deadly plagues, diseases, and miasma that give Clan Pestilens so
much power.</p>

<p class="botr">The stronghold for Clan Pestilens exists
underneath the humid jungles of Lustria, and a number of captured
strongholds in the Southlands. They also have a strong foothold
in Skavenblight, maintaining their own quarter there.</p>

    <li>Clan Warlord - Plaguelord</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clan Pestilens Champion Tokens</h3>

<p>Rats of Clan Pestilens are so devoted to
the worship of the Horned Rat that they have created a sub-cult
with in the Cult of the Horned Rat composed only of Plague Monks.
Every battle that you openly beseech the blessing of the Horned
Rat, you gain one Grace Token (Minor Token). This beseeching may
be any loud/boisterous use of the Horned One's name, ex. asking
for his help in an action, calling him to damn an enemy, etc.
When you have 30 Grace Tokens, you may trade them for one Divine
Token (Intermedate Token). You may trade 5 Divine Tokens (or 150
Grace Tokens) for one Plague Token (Major Token).</p>

<h3>The Plague Censor Bearer</h3>

<p>At each national event, the rats of Clan
Pestilens each display all of their Plague Tokens. The rat with
the most Plague Tokens is awarded the Plague Censor for being the
most fanatic follower of the Horned Rat.</p>
