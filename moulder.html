<h2>Clan Moulder</h2>

<p class="botr">Like Clan Eshin, Clan Moulder was guided
to the Hell Pit and its domain in Kislev and the World's Edge
Mountains by a Grey Lord known as Lord Malkrit. The Clan has
maintained a low profile, gathering its time and its resources.
They avoid interfering in the politics of Kislev. During the last
incursion of Chaos, a great battle was fought around the Hell
Pit, and many of their creatures were tested in the battles
around Hell Pit. Some of the monsters subdued in the battle were
later brought down to the Clan Moulder Breeding Pits to further
the Clan's evolutionary practices.</p>

<p class="botr">Clan Moulder has gained their power from
their special breeding projects and their acquisition of the
Warpstone necessary to their experiments. From their Clan home of
Hell Pit they carry on experiments in breeding. By applying
Warpstone and selective breeding programs, they have developed an
army of beasts that can rival any force that the other Clans may
field. Clan Moulder only sells sterile beasts to other Clans,
using their profits to fund their experiments.</p>

<p class="botr">The leader of Clan Moulder is Packlord
Verminkin. He controls a small ruling elite, consisting of
Breeders and Trainers. Since many of the Clan are focused on
training and breeding the creatures, the politics and scheming
within the Hell Pit is more subdued. Once members of Clan Moulder
leave the strict hierarchy of the Hell Pit, they often plot
against each other, so that considerable political maneuvering
within Clan Moulder takes place outside of the Clan holdings,
amongst the members on excursions and missions.</p>

<h3>Moulder Clan Structure</h3>

<ul class="center" id="clans">
    <li>Clan Rat - Beast Hunter</li>
    <li>Host Leader - Pack Master</li>
    <li>Clan Chieftan - Trainer</li>
    <li>Clan Warlord - Packlord</li>
</ul>

<h3>Clan Moulder Champion Tokens</h3>

<p>Rats of Clan Moulder hunt and breed monstrosities. For each
new Skaven that a rat of Clan Moulder recruits, they gain one
Breeding Token (a Minor Token). Rats of Clan Moulder may trade 3
Breeding Tokens for one Beast Token (a Major Token).</p>

<p>When a rat of Clan Moulder <a href="assassination.html">assassinates</a> one of its fellow Clan members,
he may choose to take a Breeding Token as opposed to a Life
Token. The Skaven killed for his Breeding Token is still
considered &quot;dead&quot; as per the assassination rules (rule
#5) and cannot participate in assassinations or be assassinated
for the remainder of the day.</p>
